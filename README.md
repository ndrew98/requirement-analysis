## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the needs, expectations, and constraints of stakeholders are identified, documented, and analyzed to define the system’s intended functionality and behavior.

This process involves gathering both **functional requirements** (what the system should do) and **non-functional requirements** (how the system should perform), ensuring that the final software product aligns with business objectives and user needs.

### Importance in SDLC:
- ✅ **Prevents Miscommunication:** Clarifies expectations between developers, stakeholders, and end-users.
- ✅ **Reduces Cost & Time:** Catching ambiguities early prevents costly rework later in the development cycle.
- ✅ **Provides a Clear Roadmap:** Acts as a foundation for design, development, testing, and deployment.
- ✅ **Improves Quality:** Well-defined requirements help in building a product that meets user satisfaction and business goals.

Requirement Analysis typically includes activities such as stakeholder interviews, document analysis, use case modeling, and the creation of Software Requirement Specifications (SRS).


## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis plays a foundational role in the success of any software project. Here are three key reasons why it is critical in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

### 1. Clear Understanding of Objectives
Requirement Analysis helps bridge the gap between stakeholders and developers by documenting what needs to be built. It ensures everyone is aligned with the project’s goals and scope from the beginning.

### 2. Risk Mitigation
By identifying potential conflicts, ambiguities, or unrealistic expectations early, Requirement Analysis helps reduce the risk of project failure, delays, or budget overruns.

### 3. Better Planning and Design
Well-defined requirements serve as a blueprint for the design, development, and testing phases. They allow teams to estimate time, cost, and resources more accurately, resulting in more efficient and organized development.

Optional additional reasons (if you'd like to add more):
- ✅ **Enhanced Product Quality:** Products built based on clear and validated requirements are more likely to meet user needs.
- ✅ **Improved Communication:** Requirement documents serve as a reference for all stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle.
