This repository serves as a foundational resource for understanding **requirement analysis** within the context of software development.

Requirement analysis is a critical phase in the software development life cycle (SDLC) where developers and stakeholders define and document the system's functional and non-functional requirements. This process helps ensure that the final product aligns with business goals and user needs.

Stay tuned as this repo evolves with structured notes, examples, and project-based applications of requirement gathering and analysis techniques.
