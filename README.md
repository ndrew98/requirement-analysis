## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the needs, expectations, and constraints of stakeholders are identified, documented, and analyzed to define the system’s intended functionality and behavior.

This process involves gathering both **functional requirements** (what the system should do) and **non-functional requirements** (how the system should perform), ensuring that the final software product aligns with business objectives and user needs.

### Importance in SDLC:
- ✅ **Prevents Miscommunication:** Clarifies expectations between developers, stakeholders, and end-users.
- ✅ **Reduces Cost & Time:** Catching ambiguities early prevents costly rework later in the development cycle.
- ✅ **Provides a Clear Roadmap:** Acts as a foundation for design, development, testing, and deployment.
- ✅ **Improves Quality:** Well-defined requirements help in building a product that meets user satisfaction and business goals.

Requirement Analysis typically includes activities such as stakeholder interviews, document analysis, use case modeling, and the creation of Software Requirement Specifications (SRS).
